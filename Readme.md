Ultralinks - The only link field you'll ever need.
================================================================

(Ok maybe they're not Ultra, but they're way better than General Links and a much needed improvement).


Introduction
================================================================

This is a project I created earlier this year. I've been preoccupied lately and this is not all of my work, I have to put the content package together to complete it. 

I also plan to enhance it a bit and share it with everyone hopefully by the end of this week.. (7/24/2019 - we'll see!)

This is aimed at Standard Sitecore development (non SXA and JSS)

The goal of this library is that using Ultra Links instead of General Links allows you to ...

- Define custom attributes i.e. data, aria, etc on your link fields in the Content Editor / Experience Editor
- Define ID field values
- Define & Manage Query String parameters in a more coherent way
- Use the Source field on General Links for Queries (So you can do some non-rule-based Content Fencing)

... all in the Sitecore Content Management server ... no code deployments are necessary to any field using the 
Ultra Link objects and it will reduce the amount of code you have to write/maintain for your link fields in general.

I'll keep updating this project throughout the week to put all of the missing SPEAK and Content Files in place (Yes it's a SPEAK app ...ugh!)

I'll also put up some tutorials on how to get started with Ultra Links once the Repo is finished and updated and I'll take some time to clean up this documentation.

Acknowledgements
==============================================================
I have several people who I need to give thanks and credit to for not only the concepts but some of the general implementation details as well (like Anders Laub for his SPEAK blog and JsonDataSource which is required in order for Ultra Links to function). I'll be throwing names and links to their Github & Blog accounts later this week.
